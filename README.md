# Arpilleras and Memory
This is Emily Vo's final project for HIST 2715 A Global South: Chile, the Pacific, and the World. Taught by Professor Raymond Craib, Cornell University (Spring 2025). 
The primary sources and items are pulled directly from Arpilleras and Dibujos en Prisión (both from Colección Del Museo de la Memoria y Los Derechos Humanos). 
This digital exhibit serves as a way to discuss arpilleras and their meaning to memory, resistance, political organizing, and art during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile.
